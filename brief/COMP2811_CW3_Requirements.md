# 2. Project Scenario

### Scenario Context

You have been hired to develop a **pollutant monitoring application** that displays water quality data across the UK and EU. This application aims to provide a comprehensive overview of water pollutant levels, safety compliance, and geographic patterns to various people, including environmental researchers, policymakers, and the general public.

### Application Purpose

The application should make it easy for people to:

- **Explore pollutant levels**: View data on common pollutants, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), fluorinated compounds, and litter indicators.
- **Evaluate compliance**: The application should visually indicate whether pollutant levels comply with UK/EU safety standards using colour-coded indicators.
- **Identify geographic patterns**: People should have the option to view geographic hotspots where pollutant levels frequently exceed safety limits.

### Expected Requirements

To make this data actionable and easy to interpret, the application should meet the following requirements:

1. **Data Visualisation**:

   - Use intuitive visualisations, such as time-series and bar charts, to present pollutant levels over time and compare pollutant levels across different locations.
   - Implement a traffic-light colour scheme (green, amber, red) to indicate whether pollutant levels fall within safe limits, are nearing thresholds, or exceed recommended limits.

2. **Compliance Indicators**:

   - Clearly display whether pollutant levels are within UK/EU safety standards.
   - Allow people to filter data by pollutant type, geographic location, or compliance status to see where and which pollutants require attention.

3. **Interactive Map** (optional for advanced implementation):

   - If feasible, integrate a map view to display geographic hotspots, highlighting locations with elevated pollutant levels.
   - Provide colour-coded markers on the map to represent pollutant concentrations and compliance status at various sampling locations.

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure an accessible experience that meets basic accessibility standards. This includes sufficient colour contrast, screen reader labels, and keyboard navigation.
   - Include internationalisation (i18n) options to make the app accessible to non-English-speaking audiences, allowing for a basic selection of supported languages.

### Target Audience

The app should be user-friendly for a range of target audiences:

- **Environmental Researchers**: Access comprehensive pollutant data and track environmental trends.
- **Policymakers**: View summary dashboards and compliance indicators to make informed decisions.
- **General Public**: Quickly interpret pollutant levels, compliance information, and geographical patterns to stay informed about water quality.

# 3. Core Application Features and Page Requirements

### Exploring the Starter Code

To support your development, a starter codebase has been provided. This code is primarily focused on loading data from a CSV file and displaying a subset of it in a table using the model/view architecture. The main purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to decouple data presentation from data storage, a key concept for handling large datasets efficiently in Qt applications.

#### Starter Code Guidance and Expectations

- **Data Page Requirement**:
  - To fully utilise the starter code, your application should include at least one page dedicated to displaying pollutant data in a table format.
  - This "Data Page" allows us to browse raw or pre-filtered data and helps your group apply the model/view approach demonstrated in the starter code.
- **Achievable starting point for Subsequent Pages**:
  - Implementing the data page first, by modifying the starter code to handle the water quality dataset, can provide an achievable starting point for week one, supporting implementing the remaining analysis-focused pages.
- **Analysis Pages**:
  - For the further required pages, you may use the starter code’s data handling approach as a reference, even if you don’t fully integrate the model class.
  - The analysis pages will primarily focus on presenting statistical summaries, trends, and visualisations based on the data, which you can implement in custom view components.

#### Suggested Workflow

1. **Start with the Data Page**:

   - Modify the starter code’s data loading and table display functions to handle your dataset.
   - Display selected columns relevant to pollutants (e.g., time, pollutant name, concentration, location) to make the data page intuitive and usable.

2. **Develop Analysis Pages Next**:

   - Build additional pages focusing on specific pollutant analyses, such as trends, compliance thresholds, geographical distribution, or summary statistics.
   - Reference the model/view architecture as needed to structure data access, or implement custom methods to filter and present data in alternative visual formats.

   - The application should include a **main dashboard** and at least **4-5 dedicated pages** to meet the core functionality requirements.
   - Each page should display pollutant data with compliance indicators and include basic navigation and accessibility features.

## Dashboard Overview

The **main dashboard** provides an at-a-glance summary of key pollutant data and links to more detailed pages. It should give people a quick overview of pollutant categories, average pollutant levels, and compliance status across locations.

### Dashboard Layout Requirements

1. **Header**:

   - **Application Title**: Display the application name (e.g., “Water Quality Monitor”).
   - **Navigation**: Include links or buttons to each of the main data visualisation pages.
   - **Language Selector**: Offer a language selection option if implementing internationalisation.

2. **Main Content**:

   - **Cards for Each Pollutant Category**: Present pollutant overview cards for each category (e.g., Pollutant Overview, POPs, Litter Indicators, Fluorinated Compounds, Compliance).
     - **Summary Information**: Each card should include a brief summary of pollutant levels and a compliance indicator using a traffic-light colour scheme.
     - **Interactive Links**: Allow each card to link to its detailed page.
   - **Quick Filters**: Provide options to filter by time range (e.g., last month, last year) or geographic region.

3. **Footer**:
   - **Help Links**: Include links to user guides, help resources, and credits for data sources.

### Responsive Design Requirements for the Dashboard

- **Responsive Layout**: Ensure the dashboard layout adjusts smoothly across desktop and tablet screens, including adaptive resizing for cards and charts.
- **Touch-Friendly**: Ensure all interactive elements are accessible for touch users with sufficient size and spacing.

- **Partial Implementations**: Partial or prototyped features are acceptable, especially if the focus is on UI and interaction. However, features with limited functionality will be graded accordingly. Document incomplete or prototyped elements in the final report.

- **Documentation of Challenges**: Be transparent in your report about any challenges encountered with implementation. Describe any incomplete features, the decisions behind them, and outline what would be needed to fully implement them. Honesty and professional documentation of limitations will be credited.

---

## Design Requirements

- **Primary Libraries**:

  - **QtCharts**: Use **QtCharts** as the main library for data visualisations, including line charts, bar charts, pie charts, and other visual elements. This library is well-supported and cross-platform, offering a range of chart types for presenting pollutant trends, compliance status, and comparisons.
  - **CSV Parser**: lib provided in starter code.

- **Approved Additional Libraries**:

  - You can make use of the following additional libraries, but only within the scope of the project. Other libraries are **not approved** (unless agreed in advance with module leaders) to ensure ease of marking and compatibility across all platforms:
    - **QtLocation** and **QtPositioning**: These libraries can be used for map-based features, such as displaying geographic hotspots and pollutant distribution.
    - **QtSQL**: For teams using SQLite or similar for data storage and management, **QtSQL** may be used to integrate and manage large datasets (CSV is recommended for ease of use).
    - **QtMultimedia**: For adding video or media content to the application, QtMultimedia may be used but should remain focused on project-related content (e.g., showcasing pollutant impact).
    - **QtWebView** allows for embedding web content within the application, which could be useful for accessing or displaying online resources related to pollutants, environmental data, or regulatory information.

- **Responsiveness**:

  - Use Qt layout managers (e.g., `QVBoxLayout`, `QHBoxLayout`, `QGridLayout`) to create flexible, responsive layouts that adapt to desktop and tablet screens.

- **Accessibility**:
  - Implement clear colour contrast for compliance indicators, and label interactive elements for screen readers.
  - Ensure keyboard navigation is functional, allowing people to tab through all interactive components.

#### Language Support and Internationalisation

- **Requirement**:
- The application should respond to changes in locale, supporting internationalisation in a basic form.
- You are not required to generate full translations but should design the app to allow for them.
- **Implementation Guidance**:
  - Ensure that all strings in the app are translatable by using Qt’s translation mechanisms.
  - While a GUI language selector is not required, the app should respond appropriately if the locale changes.
  - _Optional_: Groups may choose to include translations in a language of their choice to demonstrate the internationalisation feature. Online translation tools or other approximate translations are acceptable.
- **Note**: The focus is on supporting translatability rather than complete language coverage. For demo purposes, changing the locale and rerunning the app should show the app’s capability to adapt to different languages.

#### Card-Based Design Concept

- **Definition of "Card"**:
- For this project, a "card" refers to a logical grouping of UI components or widgets that serve a specific purpose, such as displaying related data or controls together. Think of it as a visual module within the app, organised for clarity and cohesion.
- **Implementation Suggestions**:
  - Each "card" could be a **QWidget** or **QFrame** within a **QLayout**, allowing flexibility in design.
  - Alternatively, a **QGroupBox** could be used to create a bordered section with a title, providing a more visually distinct grouping.
  - Students are encouraged to create specialised composite widgets by subclassing `QWidget`, which can enhance code structure and readability.
- **Guidance on Structure**:
- You can structure the "cards" in whichever way best fits your design; well-organised and cohesive solutions will be awarded higher marks.
- This approach helps modularise the UI and enables a cohesive aesthetic design for the app.

#### Tooltips and Rollovers

- **Definition**: A "rollover popup" is a tooltip that appears when the customer hovers over certain elements, providing additional context or information.
- **Implementation Guidance**:
  - You can implement this using `QToolTip` to provide brief descriptions or additional data for UI elements.
  - Tooltips can improve the usability and accessibility of the app by offering immediate help or explanations without cluttering the interface.
